# dart_from_scratch
Dart is an open source, structured programming language for creating complex, browser-based web applications. You can run applications created in Dart either by using a browser that directly supports Dart code or by compiling your Dart code to JavaScript.

This is the repo containing code snippets that I wrote while learning dart from scratch, yet again.
